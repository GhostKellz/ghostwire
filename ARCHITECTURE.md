üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Ghostwire is designed for composability and modularity. The architecture consists of layered components that allow you to build a programmable mesh and zero trust overlay, with ghostmesh as the overlay manager sitting above ghostwire as the secure transport protocol and Zig library.
Layered Architecture

    ghostmesh ‚Äì Overlay/mesh manager
    Orchestrates topology, peer discovery, relays, ACLs, mesh health, DNS/proxy, SSO, and provides a programmable API for automation and control.
    Manages relay deployment (DERP/TURN-style) and handles mesh state, user access, and overlay services.

    ghostwire ‚Äì Secure, next-gen wire protocol & Zig networking library
    Handles encrypted tunneling, P2P connections, NAT traversal, relays, and multiplexing.
    Direct replacement for WireGuard, but with modern protocols and more flexibility.

        ghostwire-core ‚Äì Protocol logic, handshake, multiplexed tunnels, crypto primitives

        ghostwire-transport ‚Äì QUIC, UDP/TCP, relay fallback, congestion control

        ghostwire-ice ‚Äì STUN/ICE NAT traversal for P2P connectivity

        ghostwire-control ‚Äì Secure control plane for tunnel management, mesh ops, identity, and peer-to-peer signaling

    Relay Service ‚Äì  DERP/TURN relay fallback for maximum connectivity

    ghostctl ‚Äì Zig CLI for configuring, managing, and debugging both ghostwire and ghostmesh

    ghostctl tui ‚Äì Terminal UI for real-time mesh visualization, peer management, and logs

    zion integration ‚Äì Available via zig fetch, zion fetch, and the Zion TUI
