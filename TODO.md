# üõ†Ô∏è Ghostwire Pure Zig Build TODO

A living checklist for building the entire Ghostwire protocol, mesh overlay, CLI, and TUI **100% in Zig**. This is your project launchpad and contributor roadmap.

---

## Core Milestones

### 1. Project Bootstrapping

* [ ] Set up Zig v0.15+ project structure (`src/`, `build.zig`, tests)
* [ ] Scaffold workspace for core libs (`ghostwire-core`, `ghostwire-transport`, `ghostwire-ice`, `ghostwire-control`)
* [ ] Set up minimal CLI binary target (`ghostctl`)

### 2. Cryptography & Primitives

* [ ] Integrate zcrypto (or upstream Zig crypto libs)
* [ ] Implement handshake primitives (X25519, Ed25519, ChaCha20-Poly1305, etc.)
* [ ] Fuzz and unit test all cryptographic components

### 3. QUIC + TLS 1.3 Transport

* [ ] Implement or import QUIC transport layer (Zig or FFI if needed)
* [ ] Integrate TLS 1.3 handshake for tunnel bootstrap
* [ ] Multiplexed streams support (QUIC channels)

### 4. STUN/ICE/NAT Traversal

* [ ] Pure Zig STUN client & server (RFC 5389)
* [ ] ICE candidate gathering, negotiation, and connectivity checks (RFC 8445)
* [ ] TURN/DERP-style relay fallback (modular relay service)

### 5. Ghostwire Protocol Logic

* [ ] Define protocol wire format, message framing, and state machines
* [ ] Implement connection management, keepalives, teardown
* [ ] Stream encryption & authZ hooks
* [ ] Logging, debugging, test harnesses

### 6. Mesh/Overlay Layer (ghostmesh)

* [ ] Peer/mesh discovery modules
* [ ] Dynamic relay orchestration (auto-deploy, monitor, heal)
* [ ] Access controls, ACLs, Zero Trust hooks
* [ ] Pluggable identity (OIDC, GhostID)
* [ ] DNS/proxy/routing for overlay
* [ ] Test mesh scaling and recovery

### 7. CLI & TUI (ghostctl, ghostctl tui)

* [ ] Basic CLI for tunnel bring-up/down, mesh status
* [ ] TUI for live mesh, peer/relay visualization, logs
* [ ] Config loader, environment setup, secrets management

### 8. Zion Integration & Package Management

* [ ] Package as `ghostwire` for `zig fetch` and `zion fetch`
* [ ] TUI app metadata, screenshots, versioning
* [ ] Automated build & publish pipeline

### 9. Docs & Community

* [ ] Document every module, with architecture diagrams
* [ ] README, contributing guide, and code of conduct
* [ ] Set up Discord/Matrix and GitHub/Zion issue tracker

---

## Stretch Goals

* [ ] Native Windows and mobile targets
* [ ] WASM and browser compatibility
* [ ] Formal verification (Zig test, property-based fuzzing)
* [ ] Performance benchmarks vs WireGuard/Nebula/Tailscale
